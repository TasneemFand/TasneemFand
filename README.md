 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 <br>
 
 ###  Who is me?
 My name is Tasneem Fandakli. I am a Front-end Web Developer.
 <br>
 ### Iâ€™m interested in
 - "Design to Code" challenges because they are not only engaging, they also teach you design principles and can the jumpstart you need into to Front-end developer career.
 - Voice acting that I am trying out for fun- just as a hobby, it should be fun, something I love, that feeds my life. Enjoyment is the best reason to start acting and the best reason to keep doing it. 
 - Translating Scientific articles in the field of technology to transfer knowledge to the Arab world.
 - Volunteering that is the best way to keep up my hobby as well as give back to the society. Volunteering is more than a hobby.

 <br>
 
 ###  what Iâ€™m currently learning
 - I am learning ReactJS, and I am looking to pick up VueJs in the future.
 - Recently I got myself into learning web testing.
 <br>
 
 ### What I do now
 - Just to mention something- The world is backwards. You need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience, and no one is willing to hire someone without experience - at least that's the situation where I'm from.
